This project uses 3 seperate notebooks:
    
    1. word_embedding.ipynb
    2. conjugation.ipynb
    3. text_generation.ipynb

which correlate with the three tasks in the assignment,

and one python file:

    1. utils.py

The utils.py file contains functions that are common to two or three of the notebooks.
I did it this way to make the notebooks more readable.

The notebooks are intended to be run in the order state above. The first notebook
word_embedding.ipynb creates a vocabulary and an embedding that is used by the 
other two notebooks.
